# dsc180a-cis-eQTL-and-polygenic-risk-scores

## Part 1:
Identify ciseQTLs in 1000 Genomes LCLs, where cis is defined by +/- 500 Mb of the gene body.
a. across all genes genome-wide (n = 20K protein coding genes) Note: might need to subset gene expression data. If so, use gene_annot.txt.gz to figure out which genes are protein coding.

## Part 2: 
Predict genetic risk for different diseases in 1000 Genomes individuals. Using Tiffanyâ€™s 23andme data, where does she fall on the distribution? Are the results reasonable?
